Detailed description
====================

  
Step 1- Assemble Wheels and 1 of the Chassis of the Robot
=========================================================
items needed
  2 wooden chassi
  wheels (2)
  castor wheels (1)
  2 bo one motor
  2 metal clamps
  4 60mm M3 screws
  2 30mm M3 screws
  6 M3 nuts
  
  => attach the metal clamps to each side of wooden chasis using 60 mm M3 screws (attach closer to one end of the wooden chasis as this will become the wheel holders and also insert the screw from bottom so that it protrudes upward which will be used to place the 2nd layer of wooden chasis)
  => now insert 2 30mm M3 screws to each of the bo one motors.
  => now attach the motors to each metal clamp by inserting the m3 screw which is protruding the motor to the clamp (motor should be placed outward and shaft should be projecting outward) and tighten with the m3 nuts.
  => now attach the wheels to the motors shaft and secure it with a screw.
  => now attach the castor wheel to the front and tighten it with m3 screws (60mm) and adjust the height to level with other wheels.

Placement of Components and Sensors:
====================================
  items needed
    3 digital IR sensors
    1 Arduino uno
    bread board
    motor driver circuit
    motor driver IC
    mini dc motor with miniatur fan
    metal stip with 10 hole
    metal stip with 13 hole  
    double sided  tapes
    
Step 2: Placing IR Sensors
==========================
  => attach 3 IR sensors to 3 metal clamps using double sided tape, make sure the sensor led is projecting outward.
  => now attach all the metal clamps to the lower wooden  chasis using double sided tape, place it such a way that left and right sensors are at 30 degree angle and middle one stright.

Step 3: place the 2nd wooden chasis and other components
========================================================
  => insert a m3 nut to the protuding screw (from the metal clamps), this will help in holding the 2nd wooden chasis in place
  => now place the 2nd wooden chasis on top of the 1st one by inserting the produting screw to this wooden chasis and tighten it with the m3 nuts (both nuts, from bottom and up)
  => with a double sided tape stick the breadboard, motor driver and Arduino uno on the 2nd wooden chasis.
  => now place the driver ic in the bread board such a way that the head of the ic driver is placed towards the rear of the robot (towards the back wheel).
  => now take a metal stip and bend one end to 45 degree (this will help to project the fan in front to put off the fire)
  => now with a double sided tape place a metal strip and if possible insert a screw on wooden chasis and tighten the strip to the wooden chasis.
  => now place the small motor to the bend side of the metal strip and tape it to the strip.
    => before placing the motor use a solder to solder a male to male jumper wire to the 2 wires of the motor, this will help to connect the motor to the driver ic and arduino.

Step 4: set up breadboad
========================
  => take 2 jumper wires (male to male)
  => connect 5v of Arduino to +ve rail of breadboard
  => connect GND of Arduino to -ve rail of breadboard


Step 4a: IR Sensor wiring
=========================
  => take 3 red jumper wires (male to female) and connect one end to 5v pin of the 3 sensors
  => take 3 black jumper wires (male to female) and connect one end to GND pin of the 3 sensors
  => take 3 different colored jumper wires (male to female) and connect one end to AOUT pins of the 3 sensors, note down the color of wire of left, right & middle sensors becos we need to connect to respective driver pin.
  => now connect the male end of above wires as below,
  
3 digital IR sensors
Right Digital Sensor
    5v of sensor to +ve rail of breadboard
    GND of sensor to -ve rail of breadboard
    AOUT of sensor to A0 of Arduino
Middle Digital Sensor
    5v of sensor to +ve rail of breadboard
    GND of sensor to -ve rail of breadboard
    AOUT of sensor to A1 of Arduino
Left Digital Sensor
    5v of sensor to +ve rail of breadboard
    GND of sensor to -ve rail of breadboard
    AOUT of sensor to A2 of Arduino

Step 4b: interface driver with mini dc motor and Arduino  uno
=======
  => L293d motor driver ic is used becos Arduino is not able to provide current needed by the dc motor
  => place the driver in bread board (with head notch at top)
    => the driver has 2 enable pin on each side, this decides if that side of pin is used or not (we will use only 1 side since we only have 1 fan motor to control).
    => the output pins will be connected to the motor and input pins provide signal from Arduino to drive motor and is used to control the motor (forward or reverse)

Step 4c : connect driver to Arduino
========
  => do the pin connectons as follows
    => since we are going to use only 1 dc motor we will only use 1 side of the motor driver
1)    => connect pin 16 of driver to 5v line in bread board
          => 16 is the 1st pin placed right of  the notch
    => connect 1 - 7 pins of driver with a male-male jumper wire
2)      => pin1 to positive rail of breadboard 
            => pin1 is the enable pin 1
3)      => connect pin 2 to digital pin 9 of Arduino(controls the motor thru pin9)
            => pin 2 is input 1 pin, when this pin is high then there will be flow of current in output 1
4)      => connect pin3 to positive terminal of dc motor
            => pin3 is output 1 pin
5)      => connect pin 4 & 5 to -ve lane in breadboard
            => pin 4 & 5 are GND pins
6)      => connect pin 6 to negative terminal of the dc motor
            => pin 6 is the output 2 pin
7)      => connect pin 7 to GND
            => pin 7 is the input 2 pin
              => when this is low there will be no flow of current thru output2
8)      => connect pin 8 to +ve terminal of battery
            => pin 8 is the vs pin (voltage pin), needed to drive the motor
9)      => connect -ve terminal of batter to gnd line
    
Step 4d : interface wheel Motors with motor driver circuit (L293 motor driver)
========
  => take 2 sets of jumper wires (male to male) and solder each one with the terminal wires of the wheel motor.
    => use same for color for the 2 positive wires of motors and same for -ve terminal of the motors.
  => connect left Motor as below
    +ve terminal to MB1 of L293 driver
    -ve terminal to MB2 of L293 driver
  => connect right Motor as below
    +ve terminal to MA2 (* see its MA2) (becos its placed in opposite direction)
    -ve terminal to MA1
    
Step 4e: interface motor driver circuit (L293) with Arduino uno
=======
  => connect EN A & EN B to positive rail of bread board
  => connect V- to -ve rail of bread board
  => use female to male jumper wires for below
    => INP A1 to digital pin 10
    => INP A2 to digital pin 11
    => INP B1 to digital pin 12
    => INP B2 to digital pin 13
  => connect 9 volt batter to motor driver
      => connect v+ to +ve terminal of battery
      => connect GND to -ve terminal of battery
  
Step 5:
======
  => now we are all done with connections now connect Arduino uno to ur laptop and upload the code from Arduino IDE
  => if you place a candle or fire in front of the sensor the robot should move towards it and fan should become on and put off the fire :-)
